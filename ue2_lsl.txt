1.For the at-most-once failure semantic, when a request is sent to invoke a function,the system will not attampt retry on failure.There is duplicates recognization
  mechanism that can recognize the repeated requests and replies£¬so the request will be excuted only once.But if sever crashed£¬there will be no reply to client.So
  the client won't know if the request is excuted or not.
  From client side£¬an identifier as additional information should be included in message.A buffer for timeout should be setted.
  From server side, server should be able to recognize the ifentifier to make sure that each ID is processed only once.

2.a£©Marshalling is the process to convert an object in memory into a data format so that it can be stored or transmitted.
  It is necessary in distributed system because on distributed systen we need to transport data between different processes and threadsSome information have to be 
  marshalled to some kind of standard format so it can be transport across the network.

3.RR: request-reply, client send request to server and server reply.
  RRA: request-reply-ack,client send request to server,server reply the request,then client acknowledge the reception of reply. 
  Compared to RR, the advantage of RRA is that If client acknowledge the reception of reply, server can delete stored result.

4.Concurrency is relevant to distributed system because distributed system is inherently parallel, parallelism is essential for distributed system.
  The concurrency model is to be inherited into distribued system.
